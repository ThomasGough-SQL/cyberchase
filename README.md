# Cybersecurity SQL Scripts

## Overview

This repository contains SQL scripts focused on cybersecurity data management and analysis. Each script is designed to handle specific tasks related to monitoring and securing database systems.

## Scripts Description

1. **create_security_logs_table.sql** - Creates a table to store security logs and events.
2. **insert_sample_logs.sql** - Inserts sample security log data for testing and development purposes.
3. **detect_sql_injection_attempts.sql** - Identifies potential SQL injection attempts based on log data analysis.
4. **user_access_audit.sql** - Audits user access patterns to detect unauthorized activities.
5. **failed_login_attempts_report.sql** - Generates a report of failed login attempts over a specified period.
6. **update_security_policies.sql** - Updates security policies and user permissions in the database.
7. **backup_security_logs.sql** - Backs up security logs to an external storage for archival purposes.
8. **restore_security_logs.sql** - Restores security logs from backup files.
9. **remove_old_logs.sql** - Deletes security log entries older than a specified retention period.
10. **configure_audit_triggers.sql** - Sets up triggers to automatically log specific security-related events.
